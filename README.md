# Cyber

## cryptography 
information transforming into unreadable format

## encryption
normal msg into meaningless msg

## decryption
meaningless msg into normal msg

<hr>

## Key
string of bits used by cryptographic algo by transforming plaintext to ciphertext

## symmetric key cryptography
single common key for encryption and decryption

## asymmetric key cryptography
pair of keys public for encryption and private for decryption

## hash functions
no use of key, it cannot be reverted back to original text, often used to encryptÂ password

<hr>

## Active Attacks
attacker tries to modify the information

## Passive Attacks
attacker will see data but cannot modify

<hr>

## Substitution cipher
plaintext char are replaced with other chars, numbers & symbols
<br>Types:-  Caesar cipher, monoalphabetic cipher, polyalphabetic cipher(vignere, vernam), playfair cipher, hill cipher, one time pad

## Transposition cipher
order of alphabets in plaintext is rearranged to form a cipher text
<br>Types:-  Rail fence, columnar transposition, double transposition
